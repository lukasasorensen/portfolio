    description: `The goal of this project was to architect a way for any developer internally or externally to create a DIGIDECK Presentation Component, which is a modular part of the presentation content such as: images, videos, icons, arrows, and anything else you wish to create. During this project I saw to
  
creating an API called digideckCORE that allowed developers to interact more easily with our presentation to retrieve metadata, send events, etc. I also created a CLI tool to bootstrap a new Component Repo with the architecture setup similar to the create-react-app tool. Components are Custom Web Components that developers can create custom forms to allow DIGIDECK clients to directly interact with the Componentâ€™s settings and for the component to dynamically render content.
